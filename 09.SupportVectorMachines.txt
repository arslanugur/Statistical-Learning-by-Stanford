7.1 Polynomials and Step Functions

Which of the following can we add to linear models to capture nonlinear effects?
---> Spline terms
---> Polynomial terms
---> Interactions
---  Arbitrary linear combinations of the variables
---> Step functions
If we add any of these terms to our linear model, the model will be able to capture new nonlinear effects. 
The only exception is linear combinations of variables already in the model:
Any linear combination of those variables is already included in the model.
