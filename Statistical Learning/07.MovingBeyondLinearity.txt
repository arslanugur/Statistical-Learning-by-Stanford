7.1 Polynomials and Step Functions

Which of the following can we add to linear models to capture nonlinear effects?
---> Spline terms
---> Polynomial terms
---> Interactions
---  Arbitrary linear combinations of the variables
---> Step functions
If we add any of these terms to our linear model, the model will be able to capture new nonlinear effects. 
The only exception is linear combinations of variables already in the model:
Any linear combination of those variables is already included in the model.

7.2 Piecewise-Polynomials and Splines

Why are natural cubic splines typically preferred over global polynomials of degree d?
---> Polynomials tend to extrapolate very badly
Polynomials can oscillate wildly once they get outside the boundaries of the data set. 
Natural splines, on the other hand, always extrapolate linearly.


Let 1{x ≤ t} denote a function which is 1 if x ≤ t and 0 otherwise.
Which of the following is a basis for linear splines with a knot at t? Select all that apply:
---> 1, x, (x − t)1{x > t} 
---> 1, x, (x − t)1{x ≤ t} 
---  1{x > t}, 1{x ≤ t}, (x − t)1{x > t} 
---> 1, (x − t)1{x ≤ t}, (x − t)1{x > t}
Every function in the basis must be continuous at t, 
and we must be able to represent any piecewise linear function with a single knot at t as a linear combination of the functions in the basis.

7.3 Smoothing Splines

In terms of model complexity, which is more similar to a smoothing spline with 100 knots and 5 effective degrees of freedom?
---> A natural cubic spline with 5 knots
Even though the smoothing spline has 100 knots, it is penalized to be smooth, so it is about as complex as a model with 5 variables. 
The natural cubic spline has 5 degrees of freedom is such a model.

7.4 Generalized Additive Models and Local Regression

In the GAM, y ∼ f_1(X_1) + f_2(X_2) + e, as we make f_1 and f_2 more and more complex we can approximate any regression function to arbitrary precision.
---> False
If there is an interaction between X_1 and X_2, a purely additive model can never capture it.

7.R Nonlinear Functions in R

Load the data from the file 7.R.RData, and plot it using plot(x,y). 
What is the slope coefficient in a linear regression of y on x (to within 10%)?
---> -0.6748
The slope is negative for most of the data, and the coefficient reflects that.

For the model y ~ 1 + x + x^2, what is the coefficient of x (to within 10%)?
---> 77.7
Despite the fact that the overall slope is slightly negative, the linear term is very positive.
Because the values of x are far from zero, a large linear term is needed to offset the quadratic term;
Otherwise the slope would be very negative in the range of the data.
This is why we usually do not interpret the lower-order terms in a polynomial regression.

Chapter 7 Quiz

Suppose we want to fit a generalized additive model (with a continuous response) for y against X_1 and X_2.
Suppose that we are using a cubic spline with four knots for each variable (so our model can be expressed as a linear regression after the right basis expansion)
Suppose that we fit our model by the following three steps:
1) First fit our cubic spline model for y against X_1, obtaining the fit hatf_1(x) and residuals r_i = y_ i − hatf_1(X_i,_1)
2) Then, fit a cubic spline model for r against X_2 to obtain hatf_2(x).
3) Finally construct fitted values haty_i = hatf1(X_i, _1) + hatf_2(X_i,_2).
Will we get the same fitted values as we would if we fit the additive model for y against X_1 and X_2 jointly?
---> not necessarily, even if  X_1  and  X_2  are uncorrelated.
If X_1 and X_2 are uncorrelated, and we are only fitting a linear regression (only linear terms for X_1 X_2 ) then this method would work.
However, even if X_1 and X_2 are uncorrelated, the nonlinear basis functions might be.
